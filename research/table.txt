name: google
demo script: demo_google.py

requirements: beautifulsoup4
portability: Python3 OK, Python2 OK
how it works: TODO
notes: This is nice!

name: Google-Search-API
demo script: demo_Google-Search-API.py
url: https://github.com/abenassi/Google-Search-API
requirements: ?
portability: Python2 maybe, Python3 ?
notes: This is awkward. Installation and this script don't work, it tries to
import "google", which might have not been on a correct place. I fixed it
few weeks ago and it ran, but now I don't commit it. Futhermore, I this
library is not done yet.

name: xgoogle
demo: 
url: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/python-library-for-google-search/ 
portability: just Python2
notes: 
	-- installing via pip doesn't work
	-- it looks like working from quick view 
	-- last update: 2009

name: google-search-cli
demo: 
	-- pip install google-search-cli
	-- then run "google-search" (for running)
	-- one of main source codes: <your virtualenv dir>/lib/python3.3/site-packages/google_search_cli/__init__.py
url: https://github.com/zweifisch/google-search-cli
requirements: ? many
portability: probably both, checked Python3
how does it work: 
	-- it uses http request on http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web
	-- this downloads result site in json format, then it's parsed via "json"
	(python module)
notes: 
	-- You can search on google easily through your command line with this
	application, it behaves like Shell. It's quite highly-developed. It uses
	other libraries for handling with data.
	-- When you search for a word, you get cca 4 results (it depends on the
	height of your screen). If you hit Enter, then you should get other
	results. If you do this 4-10 times, you get this message: "Suspected Terms
	of Service Abuse. Please see http://code.google.com/apis/errors" and
	then the application falls.
	-- I moved to another ip (onother computer in lab, from u-pl0 to u-pl30),
	but the abuse message appeared again (and without any results). 
	-- The abuse is controled by Google, not by the application.

name: web_search
demo: http://www.connellybarnes.com/code/web_search/web_search
url: http://www.connellybarnes.com/code/web_search/
portability: "Compatible with Python 2.3 - 2.5."
notes: Run with python2.4: fails by assertion error. This library is too old and
unusable.

name: GoogleScraper
demo: 
	-- pip install pip3_req_GoogleScraper.txt
	-- launch GoogleScraper
url: https://github.com/NikolaiT/GoogleScraper
requirements: 
	aiohttp (0.15.3)
	chardet (2.3.0)
	cssselect (0.9.1)
	GoogleScraper (0.1.37)
	lxml (3.4.4)
	PyMySQL (0.6.6)
	requests (2.6.2)
	selenium (2.45.0)
	setuptools (12.0.5)
	SQLAlchemy (1.0.3)
portability: written in Python 3.4
last commit: 21. 5. 2015
notes:
	-- it supports Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu and Duckduckgo search
	engines
	-- default output format is database, it allows also .json or .csv (which could
	be broken if there's a comma in a snippet)
	-- it has a support for scraping huge amount of data
	-- it has 3 modes:
		-- http mode -- works fine (without proxy)
		-- http-async -- some error
		-- selenium -- it scrapes by controlling a real browser with the
		selenium framework, so search engines have no easy way detecting it
			-- in fact it's not easy to install "chromedriver" or something
			similar, so it doesn't work
	-- it allows using proxy, but it doesn't work
		http://incolumitas.com/about/contact/#comment-611
		-- if I fix this bug with TypeError, then there's another one:
		sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError

	conclusion:
	-- although it looked very promising, it's buggy and practically useless
	-- it can be used for parsing serp html pages

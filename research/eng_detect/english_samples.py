"""The cosine of two vectors can be derived by using the Euclidean dot
product formula:
Given two vectors of attributes, A and B, the cosine similarity, cos(θ),
is represented using a dot product and magnitude as


The resulting similarity ranges from −1 meaning exactly
opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating
orthogonality (decorrelation), and in-between values indicating
intermediate similarity or dissimilarity.

For text matching, the attribute vectors A and B are usually the
term frequency vectors of the documents. The cosine similarity
can be seen as a method of normalizing document length during
comparison.

In the case of information retrieval, the cosine similarity of
two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies
(tf-idf weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term
frequency vectors cannot be greater than 90°.

If the attribute vectors are normalized by subtracting the
vector means (e.g., A - \bar{A}), the measure is called centered
cosine similarity and is equivalent to the Pearson Correlation
Coefficient.
Angular similarity

The term "cosine similarity" has also been used on occasion to
express a different coefficient, although the most common use is
as defined above. Using the same calculation of similarity, the
normalised angle between the vectors can be used as a bounded
similarity function within [0,1], calculated from the above
definition of similarity by:


in a domain where vector coefficients may be positive or
negative, or

in a domain where the vector coefficients are always
positive.

Although the term "cosine similarity" has been used for
this angular distance, the term is oddly used as the
cosine of the angle is used only as a convenient
mechanism for calculating the angle itself and is no
part of the meaning. The advantage of the angular
similarity coefficient is that, when used as
a difference coefficient (by subtracting it from 1) the
resulting function is a proper distance metric, which is
not the case for the first meaning. However, for most
uses this is not an important property. For any use
where only the relative ordering of similarity or
distance within a set of vectors is important, then
which function is used is immaterial as the resulting
order will be unaffected by the choice.
Confusion with "Tanimoto" coefficient

The cosine similarity may be easily confused with the
Tanimoto metric - a specialised form of a similarity
coefficient with a similar algebraic form:

T(A,B) = {A \cdot B \over \|A\|^2 +\|B\|^2 - A \cdot
B}

In fact, this algebraic form was first defined by
Tanimoto as a mechanism for calculating the Jaccard
coefficient in the case where the sets being
compared are represented as bit vectors. While the
formula extends to vectors in general, it has quite
different properties from cosine similarity and
bears little relation other than its superficial
appearance.
Ochiai coefficient

This coefficient is also known in biology as Ochiai
coefficient, or Ochiai-Barkman coefficient, or
Otsuka-Ochiai coefficient:[3][4]

K =\frac{n(A \cap B)}{\sqrt{n(A) \times n(B)}}

Here, A and B are sets, and n(A) is the number
of elements in A. If sets are represented as bit
vectors, the Ochiai coefficient can be seen to
be the same as the cosine similarity.
Properties

Cosine similarity is related to Euclidean
distance as follows. Denote Euclidean distance
by the usual \|A - B\|, and observe that


by expansion. When A and B are normalized to
unit length, \|A\|^2 = \|B\|^2 = 1 so the
previous is equal to


Null distribution: For data which can be
negative as well as positive, the null
distribution for cosine similarity is
the distribution of the dot product of
two independent random unit vectors.
This distribution has a mean of zero and
a variance of 1/n (where n is the number
of dimensions), and although the
distribution is bounded between -1 and
+1, as n grows large the distribution is
increasingly well-approximated by the
normal distribution.[5][6] For other
types of data, such as bitstreams
(taking values of 0 or 1 only), the null
distribution will take a different form,
and may have a nonzero mean.[7]

"""This definition, together with Peirce's definitions of correspondence and
determination, is sufficient to derive all of the statements that are
necessarily true for all sign relations. Yet, there is much more to the
theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic sign
relations. There is also the task of classifying the various species and
subspecies of sign relations. As a practical matter, of course, familiarity
with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and
application both.

In Peirce's theory of signs, a sign is something that stands in
a well-defined kind of relation to two other things, its object and its
interpretant sign. Although Peirce's definition of a sign is independent of
psychological subject matter and his theory of signs covers more ground than
linguistics alone, it is nevertheless the case that many of the more
familiar examples and illustrations of sign relations will naturally be
drawn from linguistics and psychology, along with our ordinary experience of
their subject matters.

For example, one way to approach the concept of an interpretant is to think
of a psycholinguistic process. In this context, an interpretant can be
understood as a sign's effect on the mind, or on anything that acts like
a mind, what Peirce calls a quasi-mind. An interpretant is what results from
a process of interpretation, one of the types of activity that falls under
the heading of semiosis. One usually says that a sign stands for an object
to an agent, an interpreter. In the upshot, however, it is the sign's effect
on the agent that is paramount. This effect is what Peirce called the
interpretant sign, or the interpretant for short. An interpretant in its
barest form is a sign's meaning, implication, or ramification, and especial
interest attaches to the types of semiosis that proceed from obscure signs
to relatively clear interpretants. In logic and mathematics the most
clarified and most succinct signs for an object are called canonical forms
or normal forms.

Peirce argued that logic is the formal study of signs in the broadest sense,
not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs
that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that
"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively
of signs",[3] along with their representational and inferential relations.
He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs:

    To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but
		requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be
		interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs. (Peirce,
		1868[4])

		    Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the
				work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world;
				and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the
				colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently
				adhere to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be driven to some
				form of idealistic nominalism akin to Fichte's. Not only is thought
				in the organic world, but it develops there. But as there cannot be
				a General without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought
				without Signs. We must here give "Sign" a very wide sense, no doubt,
				but not too wide a sense to come within our definition. Admitting
				that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be
				declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require
				at least two Quasi-minds; a Quasi-utterer and a Quasi-interpreter;
				and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign
				itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so
				to say, welded. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human
				Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution
				of thought should be dialogic. (Peirce, 1906[5] )

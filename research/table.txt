name: google
demo script: demo_google.py
url: https://breakingcode.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/google-search-python/
requirements: beautifulsoup4
portability: Python3 OK, Python2 OK
how it works: TODO
notes: This is nice!

name: Google-Search-API
demo script: demo_Google-Search-API.py
url: https://github.com/abenassi/Google-Search-API
requirements: ?
portability: Python2 maybe, Python3 ?
notes: This is awkward. Installation and this script don't work, it tries to
import "google", which might have not been on a correct place. I fixed it
few weeks ago and it ran, but now I don't commit it. Futhermore, I this
library is not done yet.

name: xgoogle
demo: TODO
url: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/python-library-for-google-search/ 
notes: Looks good, but I haven't tried it yet.

name: google-search-cli
demo: 
	-- pip install google-search-cli
	-- then run "google-search" (for running)
	-- one of main source codes: <your virtualenv dir>/lib/python3.3/site-packages/google_search_cli/__init__.py
url: https://github.com/zweifisch/google-search-cli
requirements: ? many
portability: probably both, checked Python3
how does it work: 
	-- it uses http request on http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web
	-- this downloads result site in json format, then it's parsed via "json"
	(python module)
notes: You can search on google easily through your command line with this
application, it behaves like Shell. It's quite highly-developed. It uses
other libraries for handling with data.

name: web_search
demo: http://www.connellybarnes.com/code/web_search/web_search
url: http://www.connellybarnes.com/code/web_search/
portability: "Compatible with Python 2.3 - 2.5."
notes: Run with python2.4: fails by assertion error. This library is too old and
unusable.

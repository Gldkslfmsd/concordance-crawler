<h2>About ConcordanceCrawler</h2>

<h3>How does ConcordanceCrawler work?</h3>

<p>
ConcordanceCrawler finds links on Bing.com search engine, visits them and
extracts concordances from them. During that it
filters documents in encodings different than specified by user, filters
Non-English documents, splits text to sentences and filters sentences
containing concordances. It uses morfological analysis, so it is able to
find ocurrences of target word in any of its grammatical forms. Final list
of concordances can be formatted as json or xml.
</p>

<p>
ConcordanceCrawler also solves a problem that Bing.com (and all search
engines) are able to offer at most 1000 links
for every keyword, which is too few. Therefore ConcordanceCrawler lets
finding keywords as for example "sdtn look", "naxe look", "jzmw look" and
similar combinations of bazword and target word. By this approach it gets
sufficient number of different links to crawl concordances.

<h3>How does ConcordanceCrawler look like?</h3>

<p>ConcordanceCrawler is a command-line application intended for Linux
platform. It's created in Python programming language (so it should
work also on other platforms). It's compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

<h3> Speed and performance </h3>

<p>The main goal of implementation is to download corpora of the best
quality as possible, so sometimes "nice" concordances are excluded together
with "bad" ones. There isn't accent on extraction speed, downloading is not
done parallel.
